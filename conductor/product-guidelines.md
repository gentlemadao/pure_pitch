# Product Guidelines

## Copy & Prose Style
*   **Friendly & Encouraging**: The app's copy should feel warm, accessible, and supportive. Avoid cold technical jargon where possible, focusing instead on motivating the user to explore and improve their vocal skills.
*   **Clarity & Positivity**: Instructions should be clear and framed positively to maintain an inviting atmosphere for both professional learners and hobbyists.

## Visual Identity
*   **Tactile & Premium**: The UI should feel substantial and high-quality. This is achieved through layered shadows, glassmorphic effects, and multi-dimensional depth.
*   **Noise & Texture**: All backgrounds should feature a subtle noise/grain texture to create a premium, analog-like feel that eliminates flat digital emptiness.

## Core UI Components
*   **Fluid Pitch Curve**: The centerpiece of the experience. The pitch line must be rendered with high anti-aliasing, featuring glowing tails and smooth gradients that visualize the "flow" of the voice.
*   **Interactive Glow Buttons**: Custom interactive elements that utilize "glow" intensity to indicate state. Buttons should pulse slightly when active or hovered to emphasize their tactile nature.
*   **Abstract Feedback**: Use interface lighting and glow intensity changes as the primary method for communicating status, success, and error states, creating an emotional connection with the user's progress.

## User Experience Flow
*   **Instant Gratification**: PurePitch is a tool designed for immediate use. The app should launch directly into the primary pitch visualization screen, allowing users to see their pitch feedback the moment they open the application.
*   **Fluid Transitions**: Every navigation and state change must be animated with organic curves to match the fluid nature of the brand.
